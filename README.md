The very FIRST 42 Piscine in Australia. 

26 days of joy and frustraion and occasional epiphany.

@Adelaide. From 21 June 2021 to 16 July 2021.

I do love this city and the people more after the Piscine.

From memory:

ðŸ’« C09/ex02/ft_split.c not completed

ðŸ’« C08/ex05/ both version of ft_show_tab.c did not pass moulinette, showing 'Segmentation fault'

ðŸ’« C01/ex08/ft_sort_int_tab.c KOed by moulinette

ðŸ’« C00/ex08/ft_print_combn.c not completed

And yes, I sometimes left my main.c there only for handy reference. Do not ever hand in work that is not mentioned by the "holy bible"!
